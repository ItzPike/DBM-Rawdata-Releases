## ⚠️ Important ⚠️
A lot of new commands now require new intents. Please make sure you read the information on the command.

Any bugs or issues should be directly reported to Pike#6424 on Discord or open up an issue here. I will be glad to help!

All commands listed (non-archive) have been ported over to Discord.js v12. All archived commands/events are no longer supported. They are not ported over and will not be updated

## 📝  Information 📝  
Welcome to my raw data repository! Here are many of the command sets I have made. Feel free to look around and if you have any questions, dont hestiate to DM me! I am Pike#6424 and I am also in the main DBM Mods Discord server! When I dont respond in DMs, feel free to DM me again to remind me.  I may forget from time to time.

Most of commands/events here are script based to make them easier to do in DBM.

I am always taking suggestions and requests and will do my best to update them on time. Any bugs can be reported to me as said above.

All commands and events here now have a by default enabled updater that notifies the bot owner of an update. It is done only on start.

## How to import
All command systems here are seperated intially by folders. Every command system folder like Reaction Menu has a commands and events folder. Command folders contain the raw data for the command. The event folder contains the raw data for the events. You would open each file up individually in these folders and you would import them to DBM the usual way with raw data.
